## Foreword

Bohrium is a common code library used in various projects to help speed up work.

While this library does not do security directly, there is a chance that the library may process critical data such, especially with the Resource Location feature, which is able to perform Resource Location to File Path conversions.

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues should be reported to either the NexusKrop discord server (quote 2^th^ of May 2022 and then we will invite you to a secret channel), or directly to WithLithum (via PM or email, quote 2^th^ of May 2022; PGP encrypted email accepted, but you will need to give the keys first).

**Warning: If you use Discord, DO NOT POST SECURITY REPORTS DIRECTLY UNTIL YOU JOINED A SECURITY CHANNEL.**
