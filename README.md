# Bohrium

This is the common library used by our .NET projects.

## Structure

All stuff that can be used on any .NET implementation is in `Bohrium.Standard`.
All others are in the `Bohrium` project.

## Usage

This library does not do much on it's own. We usually refer this by submodules or NuGet package from our own feed if possible.

Keep in mind that this is STILL under development.
